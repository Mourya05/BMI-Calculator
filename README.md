# BMI-Calculator
The BMI Calculator script is a Python program that calculates a user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. It then classifies the BMI according to standard categories such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity. The script includes validation to ensure that the user enters appropriate values for height and weight.
